# QuaDRiGa-based LEO Satellite Communications Simulation

Sharing some demos I've written due to research needs. 

To run the codes, download the QuaDRiGa package and group it into paths at MATLAB.

You may access QuaDRiGa here: https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/QuaDRiGa

Let me know if there are any problems with the code.
